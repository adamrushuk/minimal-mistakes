Ever since I read [The Release Pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/whitepapers#the-release-pipeline-model) by Michael Greene and Steven Murawski, I wanted to start writing about the various tools and processes I use for a pipeline, with a focus on the main four sections in the Whitepaper:

1. Source.
1. Build.
1. Testing.
1. Release.

However, this series may include other subjects that don't strictly fall into one of the categories above.

I'll add to the menu on the left as I go.
